				<h1>Why isn't every Malaysian vote equal?</h1>

				<p>“One person, one vote” is a key principle to ensure political equality in a democratic society. In layman's term, it means every citizen has the same power when it comes to voting.</p>

				<p>To many it sounds pretty reasonable and intuitive but the implementation of this principle has been heavily manipulated in many political systems including the one in Malaysia.</p>

				<p>We know that each Malaysian voter can only cast one vote to elect one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent the voter in the Parliament. However, not every vote has the same voting power under the current electoral system.</p>

				<p>For example, in a thinly-populated constituency like Putrajaya, the 17,925 voters there vote to elect one MP while in a over-crowded constituency like Subang, the 130,211 voters there - seven times the number of voters in Putrajaya - also elect one MP.</p>

				<p>In other words, one vote in Putrajaya is equal to seven votes in Subang. Voters in Subang are under-represented while voters in Putrajaya are over-represented. This malpractice is called malapportionment, a violation of the “one person, one vote” principle.</p>

				<p>Let's look deeper into malapportionment at the national level.</p>

				<p>According to the 2016 first quarter voter list, the number of voters in the largest parliamentary seat Kapar in Selangor (146,625) is over eight times the number of voters in Putrajaya (17,925), the smallest parliamentary seat.</p>

				<p>In theory, a party could capture federal power by winning just 17% of the total votes. How? Out of the total parliamentary seats of 222, it wins 112 seats with the smaller voter numbers to form the federal government. In each seat it wins, it only garners a majority of one vote. It loses all the votes in the other 110 larger seats. The total number of votes it secures in such situation is only 17% of the total votes.</p>

				<p>You might ask if there are laws that prohibit such violation of political equality. There used to be but they were removed by the parliament.</p>

				<p>In the 1957 Constitution, the number of voters in the smallest and largest seats is not allowed to exceed 15 percent of the national average. It means that if the national average number of voters in a parliamentary seat is 10,000, the size of the largest and smallest parliamentary seats should be within 11,500 and 8,500.</p>

				<p>This number was changed to 33.33 percent in the 1962 Constitution Amendment. It was then totally removed in the 1973 Constitutional Amendment, giving a blank cheque for the Election Commission to redraw the constituencies.</p>

				<p>What can we do? You can choose to move to smaller constituencies like Putrajaya and vote there to expand your voting power or you can support initiatives to reform the electoral system like the Bersih movement.</p>

				<p>Most importantly, register as a voter and vote else your voting power is zero.</p>

					<i>Note: The number of votes in each parliamentary seat is based on the electoral roll for the first quarter of 2016 published by the Election Commission. The classification of parliamentary seats into urban, semi-rural and rural is based on the study done by research firm Politweet.org as the Election Commission does not classify each seat. You can read the methodology <a href="https://politweet.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">here</a>.</i>
