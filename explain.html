      <p>Each Malaysian voter can only casts one vote to elect one Member of Parliament (MP) but under the current electoral system, not every vote has the same power. For example, in a thinly-populated constituency like Putrajaya, the 17,925 voters there vote to elect one MP while in a over-crowded constituency like Subang, 130,211 voters - seven times the number of voters in Putrajaya - also elect one MP.</p> 
      <p>In other words, one Putrajaya vote is equal to seven Subang vote. Subang voters are under-represented while Putrajaya voter is over-represented. This malpractice is called malapportionment, a violation of the “one person, one vote, one value” principle in a democratic political system.</p>
      <p>Let's look deeper into malapportionment at the national level.</p>

        The number of votes in each parliamentary seat is based on the electoral roll for the first quarter of 2016 published by the Election Commission.
        The classification of parliamentary seats into urban, semi-rural and rural is based on the study done by research firm Politweet.org as the Election Commission does not classify each seat. You can read the methodology <a href="https://politweet.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">here</a>.
